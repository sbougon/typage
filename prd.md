1. Purpose

The Family Summer Expense Sharing App (working title: SummerSplit) is a lightweight mobileâ€‘first web application that enables five families to log, track, and fairly split common summer holiday expenses. It targets casual, nonâ€‘technical users and must feel as simple as a shared spreadsheetâ€”yet safer, faster, and nicer.

3. Personas

Parent (Head of Family) â€“ logs expenses and attendance; wants clarity on what they owe.

Teen / Child â€“ views totals, rarely adds expenses.

Admin (Techâ€‘savvy parent) â€“ sets annual password, maintains DB.

4. User Stories (Happy Path)

As a parent, I navigate to mypurchaseddomain.com/2025 and enter the summer password to unlock the app.

I choose my family icon and see two big buttons: âž• Add Expense / ðŸ“„ All Expenses.

Adding an expense: date defaulted to today, amount in â‚¬, tap a category icon (Sport / Sortie / Alimentation / Cadeau / Other) â†’ Save.

Viewing expenses: list filterable by family, date range, or category.

Editing my calendar: drag part values across days; colored heatâ€‘map gives instant feedback.

How much do I owe? instantly shows my share based on parts and attendance.
